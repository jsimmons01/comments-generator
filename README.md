I created this project for teachers because in my experience report card comments were always a challenge to start. The purpose of the project is to give teachers a template on writing their report card comments. I provide generic comments for teachers to copy and paste so that they can get started. 


#Teachers have the option to generate a list of comments based on a type (achievement level or behavior) or they can build their own comments by selecting the statement. 

#They will press the "Generate Comment" button and comments/comment will show up on the bottom of the display. 

#They will be able to generate a new comment by clicking on the "New Student" button. There are a list of adjectives on the home page for teachers to use at their discretion.  

#My proudest app to date.
